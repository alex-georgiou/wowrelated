## What is it? ##

A Chrome extension to easily hop between Thottbot, Battle.NET & Wowhead pages for a particular WoW item.

## Install ##

Find the extension on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wow-related/ohlahljgbhgacljmakhbhnkhfmffmpmh).

## Usage ##

When you are viewing a particular item in one of the supported websites (Battle.NET, Thottbot, Wowhead), an icon appears in the address bar. Click the icon and you get a popup with links to the same item on the other two websites. Clicking a link opens the item in a new tab. That's it.

There are no options to set. The addon is very lightweight and ultra convenient. Don't be a noob, install it now!
